For this Module of Network and graph analysis we studied a time-varying criminal network that is repeatedly disturbed by police forces. 
The data for this problem came from the CAVIAR investigation conducted by the Montréal police and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police of Canada, which lasted two years and ran from 1994 to 1996. 
 
 We performed analysis over node evolution, centrality metrics, hubs and authorities.
