For this Module of Network and graph analysis we studied a time-varying criminal network that is repeatedly disturbed by police forces. 
The data for this problem came from the CAVIAR investigation conducted by the Montr√©al police and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police of Canada, which lasted two years and ran from 1994 to 1996. 
 
 
An example of the results:
