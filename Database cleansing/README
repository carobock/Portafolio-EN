For a database of over 21.000 contributors I developed a code to eliminate empty cells of the emails list, as well as check if the emails prodived on the list had an valid email formtat and valid domain. 
The codes output is an excel document with the original information about the contributors except those without email entries and a new column with their email status "Valid or Not Valid".
